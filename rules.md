I intend to offer this list as something more imperative than
a style guide, but less binding than established rules of grammar. These rules
should not be ignored. But every rule that follows is open to challenge—where a
*challenge* is a decision arrived at after consideration.

**1. Write What Happened**

Never conflate accusations with convictions. If someone has
been charged, say what they’ve been charged with and under what law—not just
what they’re accused of doing. Guilt is a legal conclusion, not a factual one.
Use precise language that reflects procedural postures: accused, indicted,
convicted, acquitted—not “caught” or “did.”

No one has ever been “found innocent” by a judge or jury. Being
acquitted isn’t the same thing as being cleared—and being found liable doesn’t
mean being guilty. Learn the differences and use the correct terms but, more
importantly, remember: the law is a system and not a synonym for justice.

**2. The Law Is Not Self-Executing**

No law executes itself. Somewhere, someone must act. Always
ask, and answer, if even to yourself: who benefits from enforcement, or the lack
of it? Would the decision to enforce or not be different if the individual had
more money or power? Note that, it may be important.

**3. Every Redistribution is a Political Choice**

There is no such thing as a “neutral” tax expenditure or
appropriation. Every outlay, deduction, deferral, exemption, or credit is the
result of someone winning an argument. Often the winning argument is written on
green paper.

**4. The Statutory Text Is Only a Start—Power Has Context**

Never quote a law without asking first how it has been used.
The written law can be interpreted, extended, avoided, and weaponized. The legislation
is only the start of the story.

**5. A Good Analogy is Better Than Any Footnote**

People remember stories. The recitation of complex doctrine
impresses no one. Explain yourself through cash registers, baseball, or
sandwiches. It will stick longer than a rote regurgitation of legislature
droppings.

But note, narrative is a tool that must be used wisely. A
single compelling story can clarify an abstract injustice—but it can also
mislead. Contextualize the anecdote or don’t make use of it at all.

**6. Don’t Start with the Law—Start with the Stakes**

The law is intended to advance just outcomes. Lead with what’s
at risk, who is affected, and what is broken. Readers care about consequences,
not subsections.

**7. “Revenue-Neutral” is a Conclusion—Don’t Accept it Unexamined**

Whenever you see that phrase, or any assurances that a given
redistributive action will not result in any cost to taxpayers, reach for the box
containing your calculator and cynicism.

**8. Procedural Detail is Boring but Crucial**

The “how” of something happening is often more important than
the “what.” Audit procedures, enforcement authority, appeals processes—they are
the story.

The procedures that govern how decisions are made aren’t
technicalities. They are the architecture of fairness or the machinery of
exclusion.

**9. Policy Without Administration is Fiction Writing**

Never praise a policy reform without a thorough examination
of how it will be administered. That’s malpractice.

**10. Name the Loophole—Then Shame the Lobbyist**

Or lawmaker. Or interest group. Most gimmicks don’t evolve;
they’re carved out by someone with a client’s check in one hand and a pen in
the other.

**11. Precision is a Moral Imperative**

Vagueness serves power. Language that obscures
responsibility is not neutral, it is complicit.

**12. Every Policy System is Designed**

Bureaucracy isn’t a glitch and doesn’t arise like life from
the primordial soup. Rules, procedures, waitlists, forms, policies, and
loopholes all serve someone’s interest. The question is never actually “is this
working?” but instead “for whom is this working?”

**13. Legitimacy is Built**

If a policy is widely ignored, or a law is unequally enforced,
don’t just note it—interrogate it. What does it say about public trust?
Institutional design? Legal culture?

**14. “No One is Above the Law,” But Some Are Close to the
Ceiling**

Equal protection and equal enforcement is the language of
prescription, not description. Your job is to illuminate that gap.

**15. Policy Is Equal Parts Rule and Exceptions**

Always ask who is exempt, who is excluded, and who is
unquietly unaffected. You’ll find more truth in those narrative footnotes than
the policy press release.

**16. Delay is the Wobble**

Astronomers detect the presence of orbiting bodies they can’t
observe directly by the wobble of their star. What takes a decade to regulate
but a week to deregulate? What gets studied forever but never changed? Time is
the wobble.

**17. Historical Context Is Never Optional**

Legal history is the law, and the law is the product of
legal history. No statute, doctrine, canon of construction, or agency sprang
into being fully formed. Knowing where a law came from tells you more than
knowing what it says.

**18. Prescribed-to Theories of Interpretation Exist to Launder
Priors**

Originalism, pragmatism, textualism—these aren’t neutral
frameworks. They’re ideological commitments dressed up in jurisprudential language.
They are often used to redirect the baying hordes. Treat them accordingly.

**19. The Opposite of a Cult of Expertise is a Cult of
Ignorance**

Never defer blindly to insiders. If your writing is
parroting what you have heard, of what good are you? But don’t condescend to
your readers either. Assume they are smart and curious but unaware of legal
shorthand.

**20. Clarity is not Simplification**

Avoid jargon, but don’t dumb anything down. The best writing
doesn’t just say what happened, it explains how it works—to anyone with a will
to read it.

**21. Write Like the Record Matters**

Public understanding isn’t just a civic nicety—it is an archival
work. The way we talk about law now shapes how future generations understand
what happened. This informs everything that follows.

**22. You Aren’t the Last Word**

Don’t write like you’re the last word. You’re building
scaffolding. Invite honest disagreement and leave room for better ideas. Be
clear, be firm—but not final.

**23. There’s No Such Thing as an Objective Frame**

Every piece of writing carries myriad assumptions: about
legitimacy, about who matters, about what counts as normal and what is beyond
the pale. If you don’t identify and shape your lens, you’re still using one—just
poorly.

**24. What You Don’t Say Matters**

Omission is a form of argument. If you don’t explain the
mechanism by which a decision was made, or who was left out of that process,
you’re not being brief—you’re acting as and editor of history. Choose what you
leave out on purpose, never by default.

**25. The Law Is Too Important to Leave to Lawyers**

Legal systems shape everything from housing to healthcare to
who gets to vote and who doesn’t—and most people will never lay eyes on a
statute. That’s where you come in, bucko. Writing about the law for a broader
audience isn’t translation; it’s the work of democracy.
